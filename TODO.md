Reviewed 2026-09-26 after the engine-submodule switch (89eb7cf) and republish
on 3fd45bf.

The 2026-09-25 list below was written before hsk moved onto the engine
submodule to track features to port from `../vocab-engine`. That switch
(89eb7cf) landed all of them: reading passages, the gap-drill/overflow/speak
fixes, the no-voice fallback, the characters stage, the learning-order switch,
and the Samsung Internet notice are now all present in `engine/engine/app.html`
and `engine/engine/core.js`, confirmed by grep during the 3fd45bf republish
(passages.json has the same 60 passages; `isSamsungBrowser`, `speechUsable`,
`bareForm`/`findSurface`/`locateWord`, `overflow-wrap`, and the learning-order
chips all match). Nothing here needs porting by hand anymore.

## Still open (hsk-specific)

### Content-policy screening of the sentence corpus
The packbuilder's shared sensitive-content filter (`vocab-engine/tools/packbuilder/README.md`
~150–200, `langs/base.py` `SENSITIVE_EN`/`SENSITIVE_GLOSS_EN`) has never been
applied to the HSK corpus (`data/hsk_sentences.js`), because hsk's sentences
were never routed through the packbuilder. `tools/check_sentences.py` exists
but has no sensitive-content checks (verified 2026-09-26: no `sensitive`/
`SENSITIVE`/`drop_all_levels` hits). Add the same three-tier screening there.

### Browser smoke script
Other language repos have a Playwright smoke script that seeds progress and
walks Today/Learn/Read/Test at 390px (`../italian/.cache/live/check.js`).
hsk has no equivalent under `.cache/live/`. `validate_pack.py` and the
stale-build/byte-identical double-build guard are already wired into
`check.sh`, so only the browser walk is missing.

## Migration policy
Every engine bump into this repo needs, before merging/pushing:
1. Engine-range storage/migration/sw diff audit — `git -C engine log/diff`
   over the old..new range for `dist/sw.js` and the `migrateLegacy`/
   `storageKey`/`parseStored`/`defaultProg`/`validateProgShape`/
   `normalizeProg` functions in `engine/core.js`.
2. `node tests/migration_checks.js` and `node tests/characters_app_checks.js`
   green in `vocab-engine`.
3. A live snapshot diff by a browser worker against the previous published
   build (progress intact, no console errors).
4. The rollback commit hash recorded before pushing.

Migration proof 2026-09-26 for 4e5d4dc (engine 63109a7 → 3fd45bf): a real-use vocab_zh snapshot
from d612e63 (39 word records, 4 sets, 2 lessons, 3 sessions, theme, showPron) loaded into the live
build with 0 field diffs after a full UI walk, offline boot and two reloads; a legacy hsk_pinyin
record migrated byte-identically to the old build's result with the .bak key kept. Inputs and
scripts: .cache/live/ (gitignored).
